# Overview
This project started as a gift to my brother that got stuck with thousands of wedding photos without any clue how to organize it and sent it to his friends.
So what my code does is just this. 
The user uploads to the system, using a user-friendly UI, photos of friends and family he wants to send the images to, and a path to the pictures he wants to convey.
Then, the system learning using OpenCV libraries the friend's faces and put the friend's photos in a new folder in the original photos folder.

## Getting Started
Just install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `python TagMyFriends.py` from src folder.

## Important Notes
The face recognition algorithm is an open-source algorithm which needs profile photos for learning.
That means that only one face should be on the images you upload for your friend. As many photos, you upload the best!  
Try to give a different face pose too.

Thanks, and enjoy it!
